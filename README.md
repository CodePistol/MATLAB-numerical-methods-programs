# -MATLAB-numerical-methods-programs
A small collection of MATLAB programs to carry out simple numerical approximations/simulations. The code files are named according to what they accomplish. Please check the comments for the explanation. I have refrained from providing a vivid explaination of all the theory that goes in carrying out these approximations. The reader is expected to be well-versed with that. 

Feel free to copy the code and use it in any way you want. I'll be very happy if it benefits you in any way. I'd be more happy if I heard it helped you, so drop me an email on the above address.
Thank you.
